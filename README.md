# Neural-Network-with-Numpy
An implementation of a Neural Network from scratch with numpy. It can be used for classification, the cost function is the cross-entropy.

EDIT : After several test, it seems that the neural net does not always converge to minimize the cost function. It depends on the length of the neural net, and the order of the activation functions used.
The main objective of this work was to implement a neural net by myself, to properly understand what's behind deep learning algorithms. I think it is done.
I will now focus on what we can do with libraries like TensorFlow and Pytorch, implementing things like dropout, regularization, etc
